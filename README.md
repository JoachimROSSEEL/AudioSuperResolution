# AudioSuperResolution
It's a project which aims to reconstruct a filtered signal with an autoencoder. For this branch, I am working on super resolution 
with spoken digit. First of all, my code create all the repositories where the files will be stored. Then, it preprocesses
the data by filtering the data and then calculating spectrograms for both data and filtered data. Those spectrograms are therefore feeded
to the CNN.
